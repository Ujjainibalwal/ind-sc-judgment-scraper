📈 What is Scrapy?
Scrapy is a powerful, high-level, and open-source web scraping framework written in Python. It's not just a simple library (like BeautifulSoup); it's a complete framework that provides all the tools you need to build and run web scrapers, also known as "spiders."


Think of it as a toolkit for building a team of autonomous robots (spiders) that can navigate websites, extract specific information, and save it in a structured format, all at high speed.

Key Features of Scrapy:
Fast and Asynchronous: Scrapy is built on an asynchronous (non-blocking) networking library, meaning it doesn't have to wait for one request to finish before sending another. This allows it to crawl many pages simultaneously at high speed.

Batteries-Included: It comes with all the essential components built-in:

Spiders: The core "bots" you write to define crawling logic (e.g., "start at this page, find all links that look like this, and go to them").

Selectors: Powerful tools (using CSS and XPath) to extract data from the HTML.

Item Pipelines: A processing chain for your data after it's scraped (e.g., clean the text, check for duplicates, save to a database).

Middleware: Advanced components to modify how Scrapy handles requests and responses (e.g., rotating user-agents or proxies).

Extensible: You can easily add your own functionality, and it's well-documented.

Portable: It's written in Python and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
